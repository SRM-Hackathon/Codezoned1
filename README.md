# IrisPointer

## About

**IrisPointer** is a one of a kind eye tracking framework. 

IrisPointer can detect the gaze and the position of the iris and produce fluid like movement of a mouse pointer by looking at a screen :flight_departure:

The **current** technology for eye tracking requires hardware (For ex: Tobii eye tracker) which can cost anywhere from 150  to 200$.

## The end goal

The end goal is to produce the same (or almost the same) experience and the control which the conventional eye trackers with harware give :smile:



## Future of this project

This project will be taken forward by the community of programmers at codezoned and anyone else who wished to contribute.
