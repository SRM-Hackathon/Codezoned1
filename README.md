# IrisPointer



## About

**IrisPointer** is a one of a kind eye tracking software. 

IrisPointer can detect the gaze and the position of the iris and produce fluid like movement of a mouse pointer by looking at a screen :flight_departure:

The **current** technology for eye tracking requires hardware (For ex: Tobii eye tracker) which can cost anywhere from 150  to 200$.



## The end goal

The end goal is to produce the same (or almost the same) experience and the control which the conventional eye trackers with harware give :smile:



## Installation

1) In the root directory, Run:

```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

2) Dlib will require cmake to build the c++ bindings and visual studio to compile. Install Dlib seperately

3) Run updated.py in the /app/ folder



### Have fun :heart:
